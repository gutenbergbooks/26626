<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There's a little brown house just under the hill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It's not by the river, nor yet by a rill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It's not on the green-sward where the gay and proud meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it stands on the corner of Bandbarrack's street.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This time-honored veteran, in armor complete,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has stood many winters the storm and the sleet&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The early spring rains and the long summer heat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wear and the tear of a great many feet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It's a very small building, and plain in its way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No high-toned paintings, not a thing that is gay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was built of the gun-house of Col Thayer fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">During the years of the Delafield reign.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then came Captain B.&mdash;he thought it all wrong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That such a small house should hold such a throng;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So out went the walls, up went the roof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus it was altered and made large enough.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then again it was altered, with the door to the south,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which did very well in time of a drought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Lieutenant G., he thought it to better&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He changed it a little, but not to the letter.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was painted without and papered within;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The roof now is shingles, then it was tin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next came Colonel B., a thrifty man&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He too had to lend a helping hand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So down went the stove and up went a heater,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thing which, indeed, was very much neater.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again it's been altered, just right, it's confess't,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the door has gone back again into the west.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The east end's been paneled, and looks very good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The door has been covered with a very nice hood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus it's been altered again and again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This time it was altered to keep off the rain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This little brown house, so dear to each heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So famous in history, so free from all art&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our hearts with emotion always will thrill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we think of the chapel under the hill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But where are the loved ones we met here of yore?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their forms and their faces we'll see nevermore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their loud, cheery laugh and swift-coming feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more in the Sabbath-school ever to greet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Some have launched out on the world's busy tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some have got married, some have died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some on the frontier, wading through strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the musketry's rattle and the wild scalper's knife.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Some by the camp-fires, with their minds on the rack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eating salt pork with a little hard-tack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wading through snow or fording a river,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or asleep on the ground without any cover.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From the falls of Missouri, with its loud, maddening roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the slopes of Pacific, an ever-green shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the Atlantic Ocean, with a coast sand-bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There some of my boys are sure to be found.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To the northward, to the westward, and fair, sunny south,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the dove with the olive-branch of peace in its mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus they've gone forth their garlands to weave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they get through they'll return with the sheaves.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Some on the Lone Star, quite at their ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eating their rations, doing just as they please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Basking in sunshine among the sweet flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whiling away the long, tedious hours.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With nought on his feet but his old Reveilles?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There to wait for a long half hour<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While visions of "Calling Day" float through their heads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleeping and snoring like other good boys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Santa Claus had filled all their stockings with toys.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But lo! from the roof comes a thundering noise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loud enough to waken all of the boys;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That old brass cannon had crept out of its lair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the Grand Celebration determined to share.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From the roof of the Barracks dark and gray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old brass cannon blazed away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waking the neighbors far and near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To let them know there was nothing to fear;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For old St. Nick had done his work,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And into his sleigh had skipped with a jerk;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And calling by name each tiny reindeer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he rode out of sight he cried "Happy New Year."<br /></span>
